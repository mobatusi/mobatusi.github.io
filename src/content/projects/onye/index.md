A one-of-a-kind digital health solution that is solving the "communication breakdown between healthcare providers and patients." Onye accomplishes this goal by providing the following services: automated reminders, patient outreach advocacy, data analytics, engaging health insurance.

As the Co-Founder between March 2020 - Feb 2021, it was an amazing journey to contribute to the very early stages of the startup on a technical and idea level. I helped implement our lean minimum viable product (MVP) using a few Zapier tasks. This has formed the basis of more than 1000 appointment reminders,  thus helping to significantly improve our clients' patient retention rates. 

Although I am not longer a contributor to Onye, I support the work of the team in solving the patient engagement and commmunication issues facing healthcare providers in Africa. Please check out the amazing solution that the Onye team has built at https://www.onyeone.com/.
